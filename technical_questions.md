<b>1. How long did you spend on the coding test?</b>

Something about 3-4 hours, I start the test last night and completed this morning.

<b>2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?</b>

The test was made by using Kotlin as language (which is not the main language I use to develop on Android), that took me a little more time.

If I had more time or, the programming language was Java I'd done the search process by both Breweries / Beers and added a Master / Detail flow.

<b>3. How would you track down a performance issue in production?</b>

Performance issues are most of the time about UI, ovedraws and time consumed scaling and measuring views.The best way to track them is by running
automated UI test and have a log of performances, but back in the time was not too easy to make suchs tests (prior to Android Studio and earlier versions),
so we made it the hard way of User's experience tests.
